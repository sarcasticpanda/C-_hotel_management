# Restaurant Management System

## Project Overview
This is a **Restaurant Management System** built in C++. It allows the restaurant owner to manage the menu, handle customer orders, and manage table reservations. The system also includes a secure admin login feature using hashed passwords.

## Features
- **Admin Login**: Secure login for the restaurant owner using ID and hashed password.
- **Menu Management**: Add, update, and remove menu items.
- **Online Ordering**: Customers can place orders online.
- **Table Reservations**: Customers can reserve tables and view availability.
- **Real-time Availability**: Automatically updates available tables based on reservations.

## Unique Features
- **Customer Reviews**: Rate menu items and view average ratings.
- **Loyalty Program**: Regular customers can collect points for future discounts.

## Setup and Installation
1. Clone this repository or download the source code.
2. Compile the C++ code using any modern IDE (e.g., **Visual Studio Code**).
3. Run the executable to start the system.

## How to Run the System
1. When prompted, select whether to log in as an admin or continue as a guest.
2. Admins will need to provide a valid ID and password for access to menu and reservation management.
3. Customers can browse the menu, place orders, and reserve tables without logging in.

### Admin Credentials
- **Admin ID**: `admin123`
- **Admin Password**: `password123` (this password is stored as a hash in the system)

## Future Improvements
- Implement a **database** to store menu items, reservations, and order history.
- Add **customer feedback** for service reviews.
- Improve the **user interface** for more intuitive navigation.

## Technologies Used
- **C++**: For core logic and system functionality.
- **Vectors**: To store and manage menu items and reservations.
- **Password Hashing**: For secure admin login.
